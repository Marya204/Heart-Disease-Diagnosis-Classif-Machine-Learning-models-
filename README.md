# Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-Classif-Machine-Learning-models-
Predicting heart disease using various Machine Learning classification models.
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to suffer from heart disease using various Machine Learning classification models.
It leverages clinical features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate to assist in early diagnosis and prevention.
## Objectives
Build and evaluate multiple ML models for heart disease prediction.
Compare their accuracy and performance metrics.
Identify the most efficient model for reliable diagnosis support.
## Methodology
•	Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
•	Model Training – Using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.
•	Model Evaluation – Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
•	Visualization – Displaying correlations, confusion matrices, and feature importance.
## Tech Stack
•	Language: Python
•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Results
The project identifies the most accurate classification model to support data-driven heart disease diagnosis.
## How to Run
-	Open the notebook Application_ML4.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.
-	Run all cells to preprocess the dataset, train the models, and view performance results.
